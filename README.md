# Educational-Content-Recommendation-System-DSA
The provided Python code implements a Recommendation System for educational content using a Doubly Linked List (DLL) and an N-ary Tree. The Doubly Linked List stores content items (such as textbooks, links, and names), while the N-ary Tree organizes educational categories hierarchically (e.g., High School → 10th Grade → Mathematics). The system allows adding categories and content items, searching for content by name, and displaying available content. Based on user input (educational level, grade, and subject), it traverses the category tree and suggests relevant content. The recommendation system covers various educational levels, including High School, Intermediate, and Undergraduate (UG) courses for multiple disciplines like CSE, Mechanical, and ECE. The final section of the code adds categories and populates the system with textbooks and links. However, there are issues with incorrect constructor definitions (__init__ is mistakenly written as _init_), which need to be fixed for proper execution.
